Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jeremi Kaczmarczyk** and I am an experienced Software Engineer currently working as **Staff SWE / Tech Lead**
at {{<newtablink "https://www.peakdata.com" "PeakData">}}.

My current professional interests are: **software/solutions architecture, cloud, serverless, python** and **golang**.



I started programming in high school. After few detours and pursuing other interests I've started my professional career in 2015.
After short period of iOS Development (Swift, Objective-C) I moved into python ecosystem starting with machine learning which
quickly turned into data engineering and backend development. 

While I choose the tools based on the requirements not the other way I really like working with:
* python 3.9+
* pytest
* poetry / pipenv
* AWS (if so then boto3 + moto)
* Terraform
* Postgres
* black + mypy + flake8 + isort
